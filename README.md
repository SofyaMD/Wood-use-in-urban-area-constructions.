## The use of wood in vertical cladding and in the construction of urban terraces.
###  Abstract:
Our work focuses on the relevance of using wood in urban environments, particularly in facade cladding and terrace construction. The objective is to study how wood degrades under the influence of abiotic factors: temperature, UV, and water. To do this, we compare three widely used wood species in the industry: a deciduous, a coniferous, and an exotic species. In order to optimize durability, we are interested in possible protections and their effectiveness.
